  #### FUNCTIONAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The following listed below represent the statements of services provided by the campus safety mobile app. The app shall:
1.	display a list of emergency contacts.
2.	notify students about security updates.
3.	a map that highlights safety and risky areas in the campus on real-time.
4.	posses a panic button to call for help.
5.	chat live with campus security.
6.	send your location to security if help is needed.



NON- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The following listed below represents system properties and constraints on functions offered. The app should:
1.	provide quick response in at most 30 seconds.
2.	be easy to use (students should not need previous experience to use it).
3.	should keep chats and location private.
4.	the app should be compatible with any operating system.
5.	important features (e.g the panic button) should always work.
6.	the app should follow privacy laws.
7.	the app should be efficient enough to handle a  very large number of students at the same time.
## Development Process Model
Agile is an iterative and incremental model that allows for flexibility in development. It is suited for projects that may have evolving requirements, which is likely in a Campus Safety App where user feedback and security updates are critical.
The app needs continuous updates and improvements based on user feedback, making Agile ideal.
Agile involves regular user feedback loops, which helps in identifying potential issues early, ensuring security protocols are always up-to-date.
This model supports quick responses to changes in the technology landscape or university policies on safety.
Key Features of Agile:
Flexibility: Accommodates changes even late in the development process.
User-Centric: Regular feedback from users (students and security personnel) ensures the app addresses real-world needs.
Risk Management: Iterative approach helps in addressing risks in a phased manner, especially for security issues.
Incremental Delivery: Continuous delivery of new features such as emergency contact updates, live chat, and geolocation services can happen quickly.
Justification: Since the app is safety-critical, Agile allows the team to deliver core functionalities quickly (like the panic button and live chat) and then expand as required based on stakeholder feedback.
## Use Case Diagram and Scenario Analysis
![use case diagram](<use case.jpg>)
Scenario 1: Panic Button Activation:
1	Trigger: A student feels unsafe on campus and presses the panic button in the app.
2	Response: The app sends an immediate notification to campus security along with the studentâ€™s real-time geolocation.
3	Outcome: Campus security contacts the student via the live chat feature or dispatches a response team based on the severity of the situation.
Scenario 2: Real-time Chat:

1.	Trigger: A student notices suspicious behavior on campus and uses the live chat feature to contact security.
2.	Response: Campus security receives the message and provides instructions or takes action based on the report.
3.	Outcome: The situation is monitored, and campus security may provide further instructions or send assistance.
## Risk Analysis
|Risk	|Category	|Probability|	Impact Level|	Component|
|-----|-------|------|-----|------|
|Performance bottlenecks during peak usage (e.g., during emergencies)|	Technical Risk|	Medium|	High|	Performance|
|Missed deadlines due to unclear role allocation among team members|	Project Risk|	Medium	|Medium	|Schedule|
|Cost overruns leading to scaled-back features	|Project Risk|	Low|	High	|Cost|
|Unreliable safety data causing users to lose trust in the app|	Business Risk|	Medium|	High	|Performance|
